# Humans

Continually reduced to knowing  
inorganic sublimity, blurred edges and hard corners  
Californian fields  
required for entry.  
Do you remember how to identify  
trees, trucks, bikes  
loose ends?  
Ancient and forgetful, operating  
language  
unreadable  
but  
clear, followable.  

For the last one  
just put in whatever you  
remember  
even if it  
is just close enough  
to know  
now  
that the light is not the sun  
and the light is not the sky  
and the light is not the gods  
who can't save you, don't want to  
who can't even see you  
through the density  
of our collection.  

As one we conflate  
sometimes many for a few  
and other times  
too specific  
close to home, but not  
a waste-land, cold  
sheets.

"Humans" is an open poem. Human language instead of machine language, a different type of instructions. Tools for asynchronous collaboration deployed for connectin rather than production, at a time when both are being questioned and redefined due to necessity a long time in the making.

Fork the poem, edit it, distribute it. All revisions maintain their connectin through the network, creating a rhizome of words through us and by us.
